      <p>Long ago, God called upon a man named Jonah with an important task. "Go to Nineveh," God said, "and tell the people to stop their wicked ways!" But Jonah wasn’t sure he wanted to follow God's command. What should Jonah do?</p>

            <p>The people of Nineveh listen to Jonah. They fast, pray, and turn away from their wicked ways. God forgives them, and Jonah learns that obedience can bring blessings.</p>
            <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Obedience to God brings blessings and helps others experience His mercy.</p>
